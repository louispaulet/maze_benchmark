Please make a simple HTML page that contains a JS code to generate a maze (30x30 blocks).  
Use recursive backtracking algorithm.
The user can use his mouse click to rotate the scene.
The camera should be placed above the center of the maze and show the entire maze in a top down manner.  
Use three.js lib, here are the CDNs to use:

import * as THREE from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.121.1/build/three.module.js';
import { OrbitControls } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.121.1/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
